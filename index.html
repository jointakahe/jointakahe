features and goals that we think makes Takahē a great choice of server software:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Multiple domain support</strong>, allowing you to host as many domains as you like
on a single running instance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple identity support</strong>, allowing users to represent themselves in
as many different ways as they want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Easy deployment and maintenance</strong>, so you can focus on looking after your
community rather than trying to wrangle with the software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mastodon Client API compatible</strong>, so users can use their favourite client
apps just as they would with Mastodon or other compatible servers.</p></li></ul><p>For a full set of features, including what we&rsquo;re still working on,
see <a href=https://docs.jointakahe.org/en/latest/features/>our features page</a>, as
well as our <a href=https://docs.jointakahe.org/en/latest/interoperability/>compatability notes</a>
for clients and other servers.</p><h2 id=the-takahē>The Takahē</h2><p>The takahē bird, after which this project is named, is a
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takah%C4%93>flightless bird from Aotearoa New Zealand</a> -
once thought extinct, but in recent decades they were rediscovered and have
been the subject of a successful breeding and reintroduction programme.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to donate to the ongoing efforts to establish a healthy
population and expansion into new areas, you can give money through the
<a href=https://nznaturefund.org/projects/takahe-recovery-programme/>New Zealand Nature Fund</a>.
The Takahē project maintains a regular monthly donation to the programme.</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Theme based on <a href=https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cayman-hugo-theme>Cayman</a></span></footer></section></body></html>
